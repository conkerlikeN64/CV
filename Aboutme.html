    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Mexico Timeline</h2>
    <p>I was born in Mexico on August 12, 2005. I grew up there for about 9 years. In kindergarten, I had to undergo surgery because my appendix ruptured, almost killing me. I remember when the appendix incident happened; I was at Walmart. I told my mom my stomach hurt, but the pill she gave me didn't help. Later that night, I kept complaining about my stomach, but we couldn't go to the kids' hospital because it was closed. We had to wait until morning, then we went to the children's hospital. They told my mom that my appendix had ruptured and they needed to operate on me urgently. It was a life-or-death surgery. I also remember waking up during the operation, but I didn't feel anything. I recall the doctor coming to me; he gave me candy, then I fell asleep again. The surgery was successful, and after that, I had to learn to walk again. Now, I'm here.</p>

    <h2>United States Timeline (Elementary, Middle School, and High School)</h2>

    
    <h3>Pre-Elementary</h3>
    <p>I remember when I came to the USA; it was close to my birthday, less than a week away. We arrived at my aunt's house in Texas, and I remember going to Walmart where they gifted me a remote-controlled helicopter. I didn't use it at the moment because we moved to Georgia (I stayed in Texas for about a week). When we arrived at my uncle's house in Georgia, I opened it there. I remember it getting stuck in a tree in the yard, and we had to use a stick to get it down.</p>

    <h3>Elementary (4th - 5th Grade)</h3>
    <p>I remember starting school in September, late in the month. They showed me around the school, and then I went to my homeroom teacher, Miss Cook. I was nervous because it was my first day of school, it was in another country, and I didn't know English at the time. She was wonderful and very helpful. During that year, I made many friends, but sadly, I've lost contact with them, just like with Miss Cook.</p>
    <p>In 5th grade, my favorite year, I had Miss Holder as my teacher. She helped me a lot; she was very fun. Like the previous year, I made a lot of friends whom I've lost contact with.</p>

    <h3>Middle School Years</h3>
    <p>I really liked this period because it was the wildest. Hearing cursing was way more common. This is where I met my best friend, Erwin Najera. During 7th to 9th grade, we had the same homeroom teacher and almost all the same classes.</p>
    <p>8th grade was my favorite year because of two things: the teachers were very good, and I met two of my favorite teachers, Miss Diaz and Mr. Skiver (we called him DJ SSKYVER FOR SOME REASON THAT I DON'T KNOW). Miss Diaz was phenomenal; she was very funny and taught my favorite school subject, Social Studies/History. Skiver taught Science; I forgot the name of the science, but it involved chemistry and physics. In both semesters, I got 80% or above, so I got high school credits.</p>

    <h3>High School Years</h3>
    <p>My favorite time in school, especially 11th and 12th grade. Freshman year was alright; my favorite teacher was my LA teacher (I forgot her name). 10th grade never happened. In 11th grade, I GOT MISS DIAZ AGAIN, for my USA History class, and I was really happy and glad to have her again. As always, she was a phenomenal teacher. In 12th grade, my favorite school year in general because it was the last year of normal school. I really liked all my classes, well, kind of, except Oceanography because it was boring. It was okay for 50 minutes, but not for 1 hour and 30 minutes (btw, in my school, the schedule was A day, 4 classes, each 1 hour and 30 minutes; B day, the other 4 classes; and Patriot day, all 8 classes with 50 minutes each). Another reason why this is my favorite year is that I got the best grades; almost all classes were 80% and above (I was always a C and D student).</p>

    <h2>Reasons Why I Want to Be a Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>I want to be a software engineer because when I was in 12th grade, I had my intro digital technologies/computer class and you know the typical teacher who doesn't teach anything and just leaves work to do. So, I had that teacher and I decided to find the solution to programming, and I started to like it.</p>
